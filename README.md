A feedforward classification model without any tools with automatic differentiation are forbidden, such as Tensorflow, PyTorch, Keras, etc.

### Dataset: Fashion-MNIST
```
This dataset in "fashion_mnist.zip" is given in the form of numpy array files (.npy) named “train x.npy”, “train y.npy”,
“test x.npy” and “test y.npy”, where “x” indicates images and “y” indicates the corresponding labels
```
